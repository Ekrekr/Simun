<h1>Home</h1>

<p>This is the home page of a site that illustrates a security loophole.  Here
is a link to an admin page:</p>

<p><a href="admin.html">Admin</a></p>

<p>You shouldn't be able to visit it because (a) it is protected by login
authorisation and (b) login isn't implemented.  But there is a way to visit
it.</p>
